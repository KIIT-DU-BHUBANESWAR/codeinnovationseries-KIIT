# Incubate_Code Innovation Series - Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology
This is about a hackathon where we have built an model of a Covid19 tracker api.As it is in a local host , so I have recoreded a video to showm the details of the project.

# Background
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has spread rapidly
among people living in other countries, and is approaching approximately 305,275 cases  worldwide according to the statistics of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing  cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick  alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, three  different convolutional neural network based models (ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-  ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient  using chest X-ray radiographs. ROC analyses and confusion matrices by these three models are  given and analyzed using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance results obtained,  it is seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance  with 98% accuracy among other two proposed models (97% accuracy for InceptionV3 and 87%  accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2).We will also predict the all kind of cases through
The models.We are using prophet model to analyxze the death rate or recovering after 15 days later.
