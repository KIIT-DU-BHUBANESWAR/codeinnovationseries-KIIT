Project Name: 
Docto-A token of health for everyone.

Description: 
In the current situation of COVID-19, all the essential services including healthcare 
have become difficult to be physically accessed, pertaining to the need of social distancing and high 
risk of virus transmission in public areas such as a hospital or a health-care center. Thus, in order to 
preliminarily self-diagnose the diseases using AI enabled software and furthermore ease the process of 
consulting a doctor, we have developed a mobile application named Docto.

Salient Features:
1. An interactive chatbot with an appealing UI for easing children to list their symptoms and get a 
recommendation.

2. Specialized consultations and diagnosis available for children, adult and elderly people.

3. For adults, an AI enabled X-Ray based COVID-19 diagnosis tool which also serves as an aid to the doctors.

4. For elderly, an AI based Parkinsonâ€™s disease diagnosis tool, using two independent tests 
which requires only a paper, a pencil and a smartphone.

5. An AI aided blind vision assistance tool to transcript the surroundings of the patients in short 
and read them aloud to the patient.

6. For patients of high blood pressure, the application can directly measure the pulse rate of an 
individual using the method of PPG using the phone camera, without any additional hardware.
