This is a credit card risk assesment machine learning project.
Credit default risk is termed as the possibility of a loss for a lender due to a borrower’s failure to repay a loan.
Machine learning algorithms have a lot to offer to the world of credit risk assessment due to their unparalleled predictive power and speed. 
Analyzing if a client or future client will fail to meet their financial obligations is extremely important, and can have a major impact on the Institution’s balance sheet.
Increasingly, solutions are being developed and improved to minimize the risk of default.
Big banks, financial institutions, and fintech are increasingly using machine learning solutions to avoid or minimize the default.
We utilized machine learning’s power to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan or not and to predict their probability of default. 

For the time being we have not implement the hosting part.
